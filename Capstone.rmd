## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(igraph)
file <- file.choose()
Station <- read.csv(file)
View(Station)

file2 <- file.choose()
Trips <- read.csv(file2)
View(Trips)

```
```{r}
